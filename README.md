Hello! 👋 I'm Trivi

Currently, I am interested in continuing to learn about Python, DevOps methodology, cloud, and data engineering, so if you have any resources or experiences to share, let me know!

I also enjoy topics related to artificial intelligence, algorithms and blockchain-based technologies.

👨‍💻 In my current job, I also develop clinical management and CRM applications through integrations with FileMaker Claris. So, if by chance you use this software or have any interest in a related topic, feel free to ask me without any obligation!
