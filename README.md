Hello! 👋 I'm Trivi

I'm a sysadmin expanding my knowledge in the DevOps philosophy for SRE (Site Reliability Engineering). 
Currently, I am programming in Python, although I also have experience in C, C++, and Java.

🌱 I am learning and applying everything I can about Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana and obviously cloud (in this case, AWS), so if you have any resources or experiences to share, let me know!

👨‍💻 In my current job, I also develop clinical management and CRM applications through integrations with FileMaker Claris. So, if by chance you use this software or have any interest in a related topic, feel free to ask me without any obligation!
